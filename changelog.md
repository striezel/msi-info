# Version history of msi-info

_(Note: This changelog focuses on the major changes between the different
versions. Therefore, it may not contain all changes. Especially smaller fixes or
improvements may be omitted.)_

## Version 2.0.0

__[breaking change]__
msi-info does now require .NET 8 instead of .NET 6 to run.
Reason for that change is that Microsoft will end support for .NET 6 on
12th November 2024. From that date onwards, .NET 6 will not receive any
maintenance or security fixes, so this application is switching to .NET 8, the
current Long Term Support release of .NET.

## Version 1.1.0

__[new features]__

* The program will now show the value of the `ProductVersion` property, too.

## Version 1.0.0

This is the initial release.
